# Cake Baking Playbook

This playbook will guide you through the process of baking a simple vanilla cake. 

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup milk
- 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3 large eggs

For the frosting:

- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 4 cups powdered sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3-4 tablespoons milk

## Equipment

- Two 9-inch round cake pans
- Mixing bowls
- Electric mixer
- Measuring cups and spoons
- Wire rack for cooling
- Spatula
- Oven

## Instructions

### Step 1: Preheat the Oven and Prepare the Pans

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and lightly flour your cake pans.

### Step 2: Combine Dry Ingredients

In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

### Step 3: Add Wet Ingredients

Add the softened butter, milk, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Use an electric mixer to beat on low speed until the ingredients are combined. Then, increase the speed to medium and beat for about 2 minutes.

### Step 4: Add Eggs

Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.

### Step 5: Pour Batter into Pans

Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.

### Step 6: Bake the Cake

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.

### Step 7: Cool the Cake

Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then, remove the cakes from the pans and transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

### Step 8: Prepare the Frosting

While the cakes are cooling, prepare the frosting. Beat the softened butter until it's creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla extract and enough milk to achieve a spreadable consistency.

### Step 9: Frost the Cake

Once the cakes have cooled completely, spread a layer of frosting on top of one cake layer. Place the second cake layer on top, and spread frosting on top and around the sides of the cake.

Enjoy your homemade vanilla cake!

## Tips

- Make sure all your ingredients are at room temperature before starting.
- Don't overmix the batter, as this can make the cake tough.
- Let the cake cool completely before frosting to prevent the frosting from melting.
- Store any leftover cake in an airtight container to keep it fresh.
